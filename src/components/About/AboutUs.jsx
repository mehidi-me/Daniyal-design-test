            In 1962, the Southern Michigan Mutual Insurance Company
            celebrated it’s 100th year in continuous operation and was
            presented with a plaque by the State of Michigan as a Centenary
            Business.

        In 2013, Southern Michigan Mutual Insurance Company became USA
        Underwriters. The name may have changed, but the dedication to our
        customers, our drive to serve them and their communities hasn’t. USA
        Underwriters’ mission as a leading Property and Casualty Insurance
        company in Michigan, remains largely unchanged from the mission of
        it’s progenitor: to provide affordable, quality insurance solutions
        to families and individuals.

        Insurance has changed a lot in the last century and a half. When
        Southern Michigan Mutual Insurance Company was founded, automobiles
        simply didn’t exist. That all changed — right in the company’s back
        yard — at the turn of the 20th century when Henry Ford’s Model T
        began rolling off the assembly line.

        In an instant of history, the car supplanted the horse and buggy as
        American’s primary mode of transportation. The era of the Automobile
        had begun, and the Southern Michigan Mutual Insurance Company was
        front and center for one of the most dramatic shifts in American
        history. The car accelerated economic growth, and offered a freedom
        of travel that had been nigh-unimaginable for the vast majority of
        people through the whole of human history.
